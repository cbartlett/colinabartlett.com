  %h3 Consultant at Colin Bartlett, Inc., New York, NY (August 2013 - Present)
  %p
    In the Summer of 2013, I rebirthed my consulting practice and began app development
    and consulting for a number of companies and other consulting firms. I bring 15 years
    of development and management experience to teams looking for a senior developer, team
    leader, and product manager. I and my small team of professionals have unique and
    valuable expertise in Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, and HTML5/CSS mobile app development,
    along with systems operations and deployment.

  %h3 VP of Engineering at AppStack, San Juan Capistrano, CA (October 2012 - Present)
  %p
    I joined AppStack in October 2012 as a Senior Developer.  Within a month, I moved up
    to manage the engineering team as Director of Engineering.  When the firm reorganized
    into a new company with new leadership in October 2013, I become VP of Engineering.
    In this role, I not only contribute daily to the codebase, but manage team direction
    and goals, mentor junior developers, interact with management and stakeholders,
    and generally keep the ship afloat.

  %h3 Lead Developer at Loosecubes, Brooklyn, NY (Jan 2011 - July 2012)
  %p
    I joined Loosecubes full-time to lead their development team in September 2011.
    I was involved with nearly all aspects of their Rails application since the beginning.
    For a time, I was their sole developer and, for a time, I worked along side an outsourced
    team. I helped to hire and train numerous engineers and shape development strategy
    for this early-stage start-up.

  %h3 Senior Consultant at Xforty Technologies, Limerick, PA (Jun 2010 - Sep 2011)
  %p
    In 2010, I sold Kinetic and began consulting with friends at Xforty. I worked on several
    Rails applications and dabbled in some PHP, ASP.Net and other projects.
    In January 2011, I obtained a NYC-based start-up, Loosecubes, a customer and moved
    to New York to contract with them full-time for 9 months.

  %h3 Co-owner at Kinetic Web Solutions, Limerick, PA (Jan 2001 - Jun 2010)
  %p
    In 2001, I dropped out of Northeastern University to found a web wevelopment firm.
    Myself and my business partner grew it to 10 full-time employees.  In 2006, I converted
    our operations from Microsoft ASP to Ruby on Rails and transitioned us to a Rails
    consultancy. I was responsible for all day-to-day operations, sales, marketing, and
    project management. I was a developer and oversaw all development, engineering, and
